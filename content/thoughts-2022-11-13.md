[http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/](http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/) - I installed xa65. There was a convenient brew formula I used to install it. My goal was to write a 6502 program and the decode it in Python.

It then occured to me that I can't see the state of the memory or the registers if I'm cross-compiling (or cross-assembling?) 6502 code to my own machine. How would I would I be able to tell if the program I was running even did what I was telling it to do? This led me to seek out a proper 6502 emulator, which is how I found Nick Morgan's [Easy 6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) tutorial. It conveniently features a javascript-based 6502 emulator complete with memory and register monitoring, as well as a hexdump feature which gives the 6502 machine code after it has been assembled.

I wrote the following program:

```asm
; countdown.6502.asm
; by Will Howes
;
; counts down from 10 to zero and stores each count in memory
LDX #$10
LDY #10

loop:
STY $00, X
INX
DEY
CPY $00
BNE loop
```

which amounts to the following hexdump:

```asm
0600: a2 10 a0 0a 94 00 e8 88 c4 00 d0 f8
```

I found [this](http://www.emulator101.com/6502-addressing-modes.html) page about the 6502's addressing modes to be a very useful reference when programming.
