[http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/](http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/) - I installed xa65. There was a conveinent brew formula I used to install it. My goal was to write a 6502 program and the decode it in Python.

It then occured to me that I can't see the state of the memory or the registers if I'm cross-compiling (or cross-assembling?) 6502 code to my own machine. How would I would I be able to tell if the program I was running even did what I was telling it to do? This led me to seek out a proper 6502 emulator, which is how I found Nick Morgan's [Easy 6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) tutorial. It conveniently features a javascript-based 6502 emulator complete with memory and register monitoring, as well as a hexdump feature which gives the 6502 machine code after it has been assembled.
